      "Info" : "Vipers are venomous snakes whose long, hinged, hollow fangs inject deadly toxins. Vipers are generally ambush predators and have mouths that can open to almost 180 degrees during a strike. The 30 genera in the viper family contain over 200 species including rattlesnakes, lanceheads and puff adders. Surprisingly, Australia is one of the two continents where vipers are not to be found. The other is - unsurprisingly - Antarctica."

      "Info" : "The adult dragonfly beats its two sets of wings out of phase and can control both frequency and amplitude. The angle of the two sets can be controlled independently, allowing for some astonishing aerial manoeuvres, spectacular hovering and flight in any direction. Dragonflies love the world's wet places as their nymphs remain aquatic for months or even years. Both nymphs and adults are voracious predators: an adult will eat just about any insect it can capture in flight, especially mosquitos."

      "Info" : "Snow leopards are exceptional athletes capable of making huge leaps over ravines. They are highly adapted to their harsh environment in the mountainous areas of central Asia, with long, thick body hair, a woolly belly and enlarged nasal cavities which heat inhaled cold air. Snow leopards are critically endangered since their fur was once highly prized and their natural prey has declined. They can bring down prey three times their own size, but on average only kill one large animal twice a month."

      "Image" : "panda",
      "Info" : "Giant pandas are famous for their love of bamboo, a diet so nutritionally poor that the pandas have to consume up to 20kg each day. The extra digit on the panda's hand helps them to tear the bamboo and their gut is covered with a thick layer of mucus to protect against splinters. Habitat loss is the greatest cause of the giant panda's decline, and today their range is restricted to six separate mountain ranges in western China. Did you know? A giant panda is born pink, hairless, blind and 1/900th the size of its mother."

      "Info" : "Adelie penguins are found in the Southern Ocean round Antarctica. They breed further south than any other penguin, venturing about 100 km (60 miles) from the sea to their nest sites on the Antarctic mainland. The males and females take turns to incubate the egg and feed the chick while their partner is out at sea."

      "Info" : "Walruses are famous for their tusks and are the only pinnipeds (true seals, sea lions and fur seals) that have them. The tusks can grow up to 1m in length, and males tend to have larger tusks than females. The tusks are used for keeping breathing holes in the ice open, for fighting and for helping the walruses haul themselves out of the water on to an ice floe."
